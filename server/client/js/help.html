This is what happens when you perform an ability attack:

1- Removes Resource
2- Applies Global and Own Cooldown
3- Check your Attack
Dmg for Element I = MIN(Weapon Dmg I, Ability Dmg I) * Weapon Dmg Global * Ability Dmg Global * Dmg Mastery I * Dmg Global

Ex: 
Weapon: 50% Melee. 50% Magic. 100 Dmg Global.
Ability: 25% Melee. 50% Magic. 25% Fire. 10 Dmg Global.
Mastery: Melee:x1.5, Range:x1, Magic:x1, Fire:x2...
Dmg Global: x0.8.

Melee Dmg = MIN(50%,25%) * 100 * 10 * 1.5 * 0.9 = 337
Range Dmg = MIN(0%,0%) * 100 * 10 * 1 * 0.9 = 0
Magic Dmg = MIN(50%,50%) * 100 * 10 * 1 * 0.9 = 450
...

4- Applies Player Bonus on the ability. 
Ex: Proj. Amount, Burn Chance, Chill Magn,

5- Generate the bullet or strike.

<<<Equipment>>>
Your equipment impacts your defence and damage. There are 9 armor pieces and 3 weapon pieces.
You can equip 1 weapon of each piece but you can only receive the bonus of the active weapon.
Each piece also comes in 3 different types.

Armor Pieces: Amulet, Helm, Ring, Gloves, Body, Shield, Bracelet, Pants, Boots.
Weapon Pieces: Melee, Range, Magic.

For the list of possible Boost for each type, check Db.craft.js .



<<<Ability>>>
An ability is the actions you can perform by pressing keys. There are different types of abilities:
-Attack (A)
-Boost (B)
-Curse (C)
-Dodge (D)
-Healing (H)
-Summon




<<<Attack Creation Phase>>>



<<<Attack Damage Phase>>>
This is what happens when an attack hits you:
1-Check your defence: 
Def Total = Def Equip * Def Mastery * Def Global 	(for each element).

2-Calculate Raw Damage
Dmg Total = AtkFire/DefFire + AtkCold/DefCold + AtkLightning/DefLightning + AtkMelee/DefMelee + AtkRange/DefRange + AtkMagic/DefMagic

3-Apply Critical Hit if successful
4-Apply Reflect Damage if successful
5-Apply Leech Hp if successful
6-Remove Hp

7-Apply Status Effects for each element if successful
Chance = Math.probability(Math.pow(dmg[i] / target.resource.hp.max,1.5),baseChance);
		= depends on % Life that you lost and depends on enemy base chance to proc the status.
