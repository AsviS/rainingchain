<h2>Image:</h2>
Loading a image named "sprite [name].png" will modify all actors using the sprite with same name. (Check Db.sprite)<br>
Loading a image named "anim [name].png" will modify animations with same name. (Check Db.anim)<br>
Loading a image named "icon.png" will modify the appearance of all icons.<br>
Ex: "sprite bee.png", "anim fire1.png",<br>
The game only supports ".png" images. (No ".jpeg", No ".gif").<br>
Make sure that your custom image size is the same than the original.<br>
<br>
<h2>Script:</h2>
This loader can also be used to load custom scripts. Format is ".js" or ".txt".<br>
Scripts are directly evaluated via "eval()". Only use scripts you trust.<br>	
You ABSOLUTELY need to load custom scripts via this loader. Failure to do so will result in an automatic BAN.<br>
