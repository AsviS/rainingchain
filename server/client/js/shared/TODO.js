lets face it, we are currently in a mmorpg crisis. the p2w model is invading our beloved games.
its because of that that i decided to start my own open-source mmorpg raining chain.

ill be honest with you guys, raining chain isnt meant for everyone
if youre looking for fancy graphics, youre probably better off with genereic 3d mmorpg already on the market
if you want a casual game that can be played with a hand and the other one on your balls while watching a movie, youll be disppaointed.

raining chain is meant for hardcore gamers.
you will die. you will die alot actually.
unlike regular mmorpg that can be beaten by any casual player


the game is based on the fact that u can dodge any attack at any time, similiar to dodging in dark souls



Hi,

I was listening to the songs you have made on your channel and I really liked your song Super Gourmet Race (http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/540968).
My name is Samuel Magnan and I'm currently making an open-source MMORPG called Raining Chain.
I was wondering if I could use your song in the commercial project.
Obviously, your name will be mentionned in the credits.
Players can also see the compositor name of the song currently playing directly in-game.

Contact me at rainingchain@gmail.com or via NewGrounds.
