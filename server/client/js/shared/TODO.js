Is there a way to allow the user to look in his personal drive for an image and create a variable in the current webpage out of it? (All this without having to send the image to the server.)

For example, the user select pictures from his drive. He can then move them around in a canvas.

Note: The problem is selecting the image and putting them into variables. I already know how to display them.

Something like `<img src="smiley.gif">` will obviously not work.
