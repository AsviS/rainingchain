General Questions

1: As of right now, all the highscores are time-based. (Ranks only show who plays the most.)
Will there ever be highscores that will be skill-based considering these new categories are already being sought-after by many players on Youtube but the lack of support and visibility prevents the expansion of those communities? 

Examples: 
Fastest Vorago/Rots/Fight Kiln. 
Most QBD kills in 1 hour. (Note: A timer is going to be added to QBD, but will there be a highscore for it?)
Fastest Large 5:5 Dungeoneering Floor. (Already highly sought-after by players with 200M Dung already.)  


2: Completing all Daily Events (ex: wbs, sinkholes, slayer masks) takes a considerable amount of time (2+ hours only including the efficient ones). 
Are there any plans to increase/reduce the number of daily events? 
Or any plans to implement something similar to the Daily Challenge system or Fish Flingers ticket system?
 systems that don't force casual players to spend their entire Runescape playtime doing dailies to be efficient.

Legacy Questions

1: Considering there will be a few bosses that will be exclusive to EoC (Vorago, Rots), will there ever be bosses or boss modes exclusive to Legacy Mode? 

2: Will vengeance be useful again in Legacy Mode?

3: Will dragon weapons (with special attacks) be worth bringing for slayer?

4: Using abilities while training Magic or Range reduces dramatically (75%+) the amount of runes/ammo used. Will there be any change to compensate that for Legacy Mode?

5: Is there any plan to add new features/modes to Wilderness Pking?
Ex: Display KD Ratio for last hour/Kill Cam
