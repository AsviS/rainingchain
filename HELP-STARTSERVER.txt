For shortcuts to work, you will need to place:
Game engine in: 	C:rc\rainingchain
SDK:				C:rc\rc_sdk

###################################

If you are on Linux or Mac, .bat files will not work.
Here's another way to run the server (works also in Windows):
- Open command prompt. (Search for command with window start search bar. Command prompt is also known as terminal or console.)
- Move to the rainingchain directory using the command "cd.." (to exit folder) and "cd [folder_name]" (to enter folder)
- Once inside the rainingchain folder, type "node app.js" in the command line.
