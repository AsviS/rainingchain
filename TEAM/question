When do you plan to have some sort of web server to host the game so we can test server compatibility? As well,
I would suggest some sort of subreddit for ease of questions and update posting. Feel it would be much easier
to manage and a lot cleaner.

Answer: We can already run the game directly from cloud9 and it works great. I'm not really sure what you mean by server compatibility.
I do plan to switch to Trello project manager for updates and TODO list when we get started with the tasks in TODO_Project. 

    Sorry, wrote that in a sort of daze. What I meant was lag and desync between players using the server. Just for testing purposes.
    As you've played Path of Exile, you know how much of a pain in the ass that can be at times.


Could you assign smaller roles to specific people?  I feel like it would be helpful if you just started giving 
people little tasks, its all a bit overwhelling ATM and I am not sure what I should be doing.

Answer: You will only have a rough idea of how to contribute once I've done the meetings with each part of the team. 
(Programmers, Artist, Audio, Designer, Lore)
So many more things need to be said before I can actually give a role and ask tasks to someone.
However, very little people wrote down their availability for the future meeting so everything is kinda in stand-by. 
I guess I'll apply some pressure to get things moving. 





[KC]: If I may interject, depending on what area you work in you may want to take initiative. For instance,
      us lore people have it pretty easy, we get to write whatever we want and it can be omitted and altered
      with relative ease. 

Answer: I guess the lore can start thinking about some ideas. But at the same time, without an initial meeting, everyone are going run in different directions.
