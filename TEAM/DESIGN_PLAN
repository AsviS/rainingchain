The reasons behind these thoughts will be explained in detail during the meeting.
DONT JUMP TO CONCLUSION TOO FAST.

RAW VERSION - First Draft


Goal: 
Easy for beginner/casual players. Hard to master for hardcore gamers.
Not pay to win.
Skills + Effort > In-game currency

##quest##
Game based around quests.
Casual players: Complete quest once. Get random roll. 
Hardcore players: Complete quest multiple times until they get perfect roll.
reward difference is minimal but still there. doesnt feel like a waste/useless for hardcore players.
however, being able to redo quest => skippable dialogue and puzzle based quest are so-so

quests will be made by players
they have total freedom over quest difficulty and boss/enemy
the only reward a quest can give is a permanent stat bonus
bonus depends on reputation of player who made the quest and on the quest rating by other players
quests need to respect the lore. the team need to test the quest before its accepted and added to the game.

In MMO, unlike solo games, there must be no end.
I dont want 1 main quest that once done, player feel he has beaten the game.
quest system similar to Runescape: multiple quest series allowing great variety.
in order for the game to grow over time, it cant have an end.

##no hard choices##
decision made by player are always reversible.
i dont want to force players to keep same game style. (ex: choosing a class)
class are main reason for complain in most mmo.


##death##
no hard penalty for death. only time lost
encourage players to try new things
i dont want players to not do content because they dont want to die

##enemy##
encourage players to work together. 
no kill steal. number 1 frustration.
award everyone equally but penalty if youre too low or too high lvl for the zone.

no camping a single monster all the time.
i want players to explore and battle group of monsters partly randomly generated.
enemy are everytime different and player need to adapt to imprevisible situation. (similar to diablo3 and path of exile enemy mods)


##skilling##
players dont do only 1 skill in particular non-stop
ex: u do dungeon, at the end, theres tree that u can cut for exp and resources
otherwise, its too easy for bots and its just grinding for players.


##cycle##
everyday, +1% to all elements in the game. when player use it, the boost is reset
apply to dungeon, skills, quest
good => variety, more complexity for hardcore.
        help casual
        no dead content



##player customization##
offer real customization and encourage creative builds 
done via passive popularity

The bonus from each passive is dynamic and depends on the current popularity of the passive.
Popular passives values, most often used in Overpowered builds, are decreased while unpopular ones are boosted. 
In other games, nerfs make OP builds become unviable builds brutally while my system allows a smooth transition and auto-balance. 
But more importantly, it assures a true and fair character customization, encouraging people to play home-made builds.


##leagues##
I dont want strict league. that would split community.
if there are different leagues, they would be in same instance.
leagues need to be harder and would have own highscore. 
players can decide to convert to standard anytime


##equip##
the best equipment of the game can only be found by yourself by playing the game.

crafting system:
kill monsters until you find a plan.
plan require to collect resource (ex: ore)
if you collect everything yourself, the equip made out of the plan has +1 attribute
if you soulbound a equip, it gains +1 attribute

high-lvl plan also require shards. shards are obtained by salvaging other equip
=> creating unlucky rolled equip is not a total waste

##items type##

skill trios

combat  gather  craft
--------------------------
melee - mining - smithing
range - wc  - fletch
magic - hunt - craft

melee   range   magic
------------------------
metal - wood - bone
chain - leaf - hide
ruby - sapph - topaz


the item type impacts the possible boost of that equip




##economy##
currency needs to be
1- useful and consumable
2- if more currency is in the game, players are encouraged to consume it more.

currency: orbs
used to modify equipment pieces.
no limit to the amount of orbs used on the item.
however, it has diminushing returns

goal is to have a solid low-lvl economy.
low-lvl items need to be worth something otherwise, new players will quit
any item should have a chance to be worth something

limit impact of wealth on success of account
money is important but cant buy everything with it


##forums##
forums place for
-discussion like normal games
-trade: directly on forum, u can link items to others. ex: http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/695420
-create projects
    encourage players to group to create new quests
    allow players to have their own cloud9 page where they can work all on the same code at the same time .
-there will be a contribution system. when player submit a great quest/spritesheet, he gains contribution pts.
    pts are used as show-off and used to determined the quest reward
-documentation
    directly ingame (below game canvas)
    wiki-like

##contribution pts##
pts given for ppl who contribute (players)
can be used for cosmetics stuff, badges
pts also given for advertizmenet via youtube, twitch
