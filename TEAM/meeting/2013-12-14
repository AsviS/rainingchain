December 14th: Summary
    More Detailed Overview of the Game.
    
    More meetings will be needed to actually start the development of the game.
    I also plan to make tutorial vids to save time. 
    Future meetings will be more focused on questions and more specialized too.

1. Team Presentation]
My name is Samuel. I make youtube videos. Ive played mostly Runescape, Diablo, Path of Exile, Guild Wars 2, ROTMG.
Im studying computer sciences in Montreal. I'm french canadian.

Many people want to be part of the team. 
There is a big level difference in the team.
But dont worry, you can still contribute to the project.
If youre beginner artist: edit icons, edit spritesheet. Make rough draft.
If beginner programmer: small portion of code. wait for instruction of others.


2. General Direction/Goal of the Game

check DESIGN_PLAN


3. Brief Overview of Code

check GAME_MECHANICS


4. Brief Overview of Art

The goal is to create a game where everyone can contribute.
Right now, the artwork is too fancy. It would be too hard to add more elements to it. Also mean we are bound to certain artists.
Im looking for art less fancy than what it is right now, but better than ROTMG.

Images are split in 4 categories:

-Anim/Animation
Series of images of same size. check initAnimDb in sprite.js
Anim can occur on a specific xy place or on a certain actor.

-Sprite
Sprites follow this format:
Same convention for NPC, Enemy, Bullet, Player.

"pMace":{                               //id
    "src":"img/Player/human.png"        //image src
    "size":1.5,                         //size factor
    "side":[2,6,0,4,1,5,3,7],           //side[0] = 2 => the right-facing position is in the 3rd row. 
    'hpBar':-40,                        //hp bar distance from center (in y)
    'legs':35,                          //used when sorting draw by y.
	"preHitBox":[ -12,12,-35,35 ],      //hitbox before size factor (for dmg collision)
	"preBumperBox":[ -12,12,0,35 ],     //bumperbox before size factor  (for map collision)
	"anim": {                           //list of animations
		"Walk":{            //name
		    "startY":0,     //startY pixel
	    	"frame":4,      //how many frames?
	    	"sizeX":70,     //size of 1 frame in x
	    	"sizeY":70,     //size of 1 frame in y
	    	"dir":8,        //how many direction can it face? (usually 4 or 8 if diagonal)
	    	"spd":0.8,      //speed of animation. 1 spd => every game frame, it moves to the next frame
	    	'walk':1,       //if walk, movement speed will impact frame spd
	    	"next":"Walk"   //once animation complete, what animation to do?    //default is Walk
	    },
		"Attack":{"startY":0,"frame":4,"sizeX":70,"sizeY":70,"dir":8,"spd":0.8,"next":"Walk"}
	}},


-Map
Maps are divide in 2 images: above player and below player.
Map also need a collision layer.
Made via Tiled.

-Icon
All icons are in the iconsheet. It uses a double index to identify the icons.
Made via Tiled.

4.1: Brief Overview of Lore

What makes a MMO unique is the universe where it takes place.
The goal right now is to create this universe.
Players are going to create quests based on this lore.

I dont want any main quest. Main quest are great for solo games, not for MMO.
There must be no end in a MMO.
Goal is to make immersive experience.

Most of the lore wont be directly in the game. But its going to be added little by little with quests.
Lore must not be added brutally. It must be omnipresent all the time, in every small aspect.
Think about the different countries/face/clan as a real ecosystem that evolves with time.

Each race should have a list of religious beliefs that evolved over time, politics/economy that fits with their geographic location.


### Example 1: Tower of Death near village.

What the lore says:
tower was built during the first age by the elves. it was used to spy the orcs over the mountain. elves abandonned tower.
A group of satanist priest took the tower to perform rituals. they managed to summon a demon. That demon killed all the priests.
A legend started circulating about the tower. it is said that spirits haunt the tower and that food must be put in front of the door to keep them away.
Theres an elfic logo on the wall of tower, painted by the elfs when they built it.

What players see: 
Tower with elfic logo. Theres Food in front of tower.
If player ask villagers why there is food, villagers say its to keep away the spirits of tower.
If asked to young villagers, they say its only superstitions.

Ideas given to players to create quests:
-Player take the food. Demon comes out and attack player.
-Player poison the food. 
-Player forces his way in the tower.


### Example 2:

What the lore says: 
2k years ago, the god XXX and the god YYY fought in the jungle. The battle was so intense that it destroyed the jungle.

What players see: 
In the middle of the jungle, theres a big wasteland.

Ideas givent to players to create quests:
Search a cave in the wasteland that would contain god artefacts.




4.2: Brief Overview of Sound/Music

Planned system:
Add SFX to animations. Can add delay/volume mod to it.
Also plan music list for each region.

Id want a least 1 iconic music song so players associate the game with it.

5. Cloud9 Introduction

Similar to Google Docs: 1 public version of the code.
Name next to the modifications.
I also have access to more advanced log.
Ctrl + Shift + F: search in all files
File => Download to download the project.


6. Running the game locally

To run the game yourself: (Video Guide coming soon)
-Install NodeJS: http://nodejs.org/
-Download the game: File -> Download        (Or https://www.mediafire.com/?zackcz5k7seb204) Github link coming soon
-Unzip.
-From command line: node app.js in the rainingchain directory.
-Go to http://localhost:3000/

####
Programmers special codes:
ts('string');

the string will be eval on server side (only works if your username is sam)

handy examples:
ts('p.map = "test"');
ts('p.hp = 1000');
ts('addInv(key,"gold");');
ts('changeSprite(p,{name:"pMace"})');
ts('changeSprite(p,{anim:"Attack"})');




7. Softwares (Tiled, Glueit, ImageMagick...)

Creating Maps with Tiled:
steps:
1. create map with tiled using template.tmx
2. compress map with compress.bat
3. crop map with PNGoo.exe
4. generate collision grid with luaToCollisionGrid.js
5. add to game in /server/map.js

Creating Icons with Tiled:
-open iconSheet.tmx
-drag and drop

Imagick
used for cropping

PNGoo
used for compress

glueit
concat images together. images need to be about same size for it to work good.
