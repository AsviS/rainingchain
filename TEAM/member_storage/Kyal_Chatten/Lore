####[1a]Black Forest####
########################

large forest divided into 3 sections like a target. 

The outer ring is the largest and has extremely dense foliage. So much so that
almost no light penetrates it. The animals here are nocturnal, and there is 
never any daylight in the outside ring, making it very perilous. 

The middle ring contains some breaks in the trees which are the result of small
ponds. The small pools of light are still hardly visible until you get close to
them. 

The inner circle is all dead trees, many charred. Vultures scour the skies, and 
poisonous insects swarm those who enter. The inner circle contains a single ruin
which goes deep underground. It is the home of the God Miq'ahr. Miq'har is 
a tunneling worm whos mawspan is easily fifteen feet in radius. It's skin is 
specially designed armor which helps it screw through the dirt with little 
resistance. Miq'ahr is worshiped as the World Eater by some Terracians. Other 
Terracians worship the Goddess Helena. Helena was the name given to the first
sapling planted 15000 years ago, which then grew into the entire Black Forest.

The Terracians are a number of different species that inhabit the Black Forest.

Terracians resemble raptors (hawks etc), owls, lizards and small mammals. 
Terracians are renowned for their hunting skills, and their survival skills.
Terracians are skilled alchemists and herblorists.
Terracians have two dieties. Those who worship Miq'ahr are prone to stalking,
    murder and sacrifice. Those who worship Helena tend to be very aggressive 
    when outsiders intrude. They will attempt to scare them into leaving, or 
    getting hopelessly lost. 
Terracians that become Helena devouts are rendered physical spirits. They must 
    first willingly sacrifice their earthly body to the God Miq'Ahr in a very
    ritualistic fashion. 
Terracians that become Miq'Ahr Zealots must sacrifice another Terracian to 
    Miq'ahr in a ritualistic manor.

####[1b]Outer Ring####
######################

Most of the outer ring is simply too dark to sustain normal life. Due to the 
conditions, most of the fungus has adapted to be bioilluminescent and use it
to lure prey to their demise. The constant decay that occurs in the outer ring
be it plant or prey matter, attracts many different insects. These insects are
unique pollenators which create a variety of plant life. Some feed off the 
insects, and others have adapted deep rooting to syphon the large trees roots.

Most of the animals in the outer ring are birds, bats and the occasional lizard.
Most lizards in the Black Forest have adapted a very powerful venom so they can
    strike birds or bats and then track the body down when they die.

Skeletons are strewn about in the outer ring. Many adventureres are simply 
    unprepared when they get lost. Some are attacked, others starve. You can 
    scavenge the corpses if you come across them.
    
Occasionally both Miq'Ahr Zealots and Helena Devout scouts can occasionally be
    found making their rounds and tracking intruders.

####[1c]Inner Ring####
######################

The inner ring is more of a neutral zone. The pools of light attract small 
mammals and lizards for sustenance and warmth. The tree density becomes sparcer
and patches of grass begin to grow. Helena Devouts are more commonly found 
roaming these territories protecting the trees from harm and the animals from 
being hunted. They rush intruders and dissipate right infront of their faces
inflicting them with terrible nightmares.

The animals found in the inner ring are mainly ferret type animals and chameleon
    type lizards.
    
Terracians can occasionally be found wandering the inner ring searching for 
    materials for their potions.
    
Terracians have small underground huts that are often hidden in the natural 
    terrain. Some of the larger Terracian huts are used as bandit hideouts
    because of the Terracians fantastic trapmaking skills.

####[1d]Miq'Ahr Ruins####
#########################

The Miq'Ahr Ruins are impossible to miss once you get close to the edge of the
inner ring. Legend has it, Miq'Ahr was originally in an impressively large
meteorite that was barreling straight for the planet. Kingdoms everywhere
put their best strategists to work. Meanwhile, a young lady who seemingly
appeared from no where, had stood on the highest point of the planet and simply
stared into the sky for three days straight. She didn't eat, drink or talk when
crowds gathered. On the fourth day, she readied her bow and aimed it straight
into the sky. She released her arrow and the snapping of the bowstring sent a 
thunderous roar across the entire planet. She left on the fifth day, never to 
be seen by any account ever again. Her identity remains a mystery, and how 
she cracked a meteorite fifteen barns wide with a single arrow is popular
study in Terracian culture. 

Miq'Ahr awoke when the arrow struck his cocoon, splitting it in half. He fell
through the atmosphere and prepared himself for planet impregnation. He landed
deep in a forest, flattening trees and scorching the earth. He bore a hole into 
the earth and began consuming. No one knows just how weak the planet is due
to all of his tunnels. It is said that Helena was planted by the woman who awoke
Miq'Ahr, right before she went into the Miq'Ahr Ruins searching for her enemy.

The scorched earth draws alot of insects that feed on rotting wood and high 
temperatures. Some lizards have adapted to the terrain. they don't oft carry 
venom but rather they tend to use toxic poisons to their advantage.
