###Special Event###
###################

Every 100 years in the Crater of life, a magical tree sprouts in the very center of the crater. It then takes
30 days to fully sprout into the tree of new beginnings. Solas the god of creation made this tree sprout to spread life
through Valerias. The tree of new beginnings is only alive for 7 days after it has been fully sprouted. Once it's on it's 7th day it will start
to die. The Tree of New Beginnings has godly powers within its trunk. Humans call it the souls of many lives, Dragons name it the fire 
that flows within their veins. The Tree of New Beginnings has a powerful sap-type liquid that gives anyone that drinks that the power of any god. If you are a mortal
instead of actually being a god you would be a Demi-God and would live forever with the power of the tree. If one of the gods tries to drink the sap of the tree then
they would recieve the power of an Elder God until the Tree of Beginning's death is complete. It has 3 stages before its final death.

#######################################
####Tree of New Beginnings 3 Stages*###
#######################################

Stage 1: Life- when it is sprouting to its full form.
Stage 2: Creation- When it gives the life to other forms. Ex. (A dying being touches the tree, and becomes healthy and lives on).
Stage 3: Death- It takes 3 days for the tree to fully die. First, leaves of the tree first starts to fall. Secondly, The branches will then fall from the tree.
Lastly, The tree trunk will sink into the ground. 

If the sap is extracted while in stage one the tree will skip stage 2 (since it uses its sap to give life to beings) and go straight stage 3. 

Each God is different from each other, when a different God drinks the sap from the tree, they will have different powers from one another. Elder God powers can vary
within each god. I won't go into further details for now :) I'll leave it at that.

Solas created Thaghor who was once a god that was to protect the tree from any harm. Solas told Thaghor that the sap of the tree creates life and the tree needs to 
be protected from anyone that wants to harm it. But Thaghor felt like he wasn't getting the respect he deserved from Solas, so he destroyed the tree, he noticed as he
severed the tree's trunk he seen the sap Solas spoke of. He drinks the sap and notice as the tree turns black and he experiencing an overpowering sensation.
Solas appeared and seen what had happened, he didn't expect Thaghor to drink the sap from the tree. He then notice that Thaghor had become an Elder God. They both fought and
on Solas's last breathe he finally banishes Thaghor to another dimension. He then creates six new gods and told them only protect the tree, he never told them about the powers
that the tree holds. Lastly, he seals a sign on their chests each showing a different sign. He then tells them to protect each race on Valerias and vanishes from the world.

More to be said about this. Its not completed but I gave a brief summary of history on the tree. There are more stories to be made about the different gods, but this 
is just a brief idea.

###Conclusion of my Lore Idea###
################################

Okay so this is basically my general idea I rattle up myself. Hopefully it could give you 
some type of idea of what i was thinking. I didn't go into much detail on some of what i 
posted. The reason is that i don't want to get ahead of myself of course their are 
questions to be asked about some of this. But thats the idea, you should be asking 
questions and thinking of ways to go about the lore. Anyway thanks for reading i know it 
was quite a bit.

Don't change anything just post your ideas or questions at the bottom thank you.
