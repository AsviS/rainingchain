Once we actually start working on the project, the team will be using the Project Manager Trello. It will help coordinate tasks.
NEW TODO:
-Create a Trello Account on https://trello.com/signup. Use the same name than your cloud9 username to keep things simple.

I will then add you to the list of members of the project.

The meeting for Programmers will happen on Monday December 23rd at 4pm UTC/GMT. 
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20131223T16
I'm expecting Jesse G., Justin H. and Robin VdB. to be present. (In theory, Lansana C. and Elijah B. should be there too.)
If there's an issue with this date, please let me know.
I'll be waiting for you in cloud9 but the actual meeting will take place either on cloud9, skype or twitch depending on how many people show up.

For the other part of the team (Audio, Graphic etc...), I don't think a actual meeting would be needed. I will talk to you individually instead.

@Chando42: I've already talked with Stephano about the audio. Whenever you are online, I'll do the "meeting" with you.
@Kyal: I've already talked a little with Robert about the lore. You can talk to him for some info. Also, whenever you are online, I'll do the "meeting" with you.
@Ulysses and Josiah: Whenever you are online,  I'll do the "meeting" with you.
@kevyn: Whenever you are online, I'll do the "meeting" with you.

I wasn't very clear with my instructions recently so I made this easy step-by-step list of things you must do right now to stay up-to-date with the project.
Failure to do the following will mean that you are no longer interested or serious enough to be part of the project. 

TODO List:

ALL:
-Create Cloud9 Account. (Everyone needs a cloud9 account, even graphic artists.)
-Send me your Cloud9 Username by email to rainingchain@gmail.com so I can grant you Read-Write Privilege.
-Be able to run the game locally on your own computer (check TEAM/tutorial/running_locally)
-Put your name in the "I Read It" section of that tutorial
-Read the summary of the meeting 2013-12-14 (TEAM/meeting/2013-12-14)
-Put your name in the "I Read It" section of the meeting
-Write your availability in TEAM/meeting/AVAILABILITY
-Read the future_meeting summary (TEAM/meeting/future_meeting)
-Everyday, check TEAM/ANNOUNCEMENT. If there's something new, write your name in the "I Read It" section. (This includes this announcement.)
-Everyday, check TEAM/TODO_TEAM to know if there's something new to do.

ARTIST ONLY:
-Watch all the tutorials below TEAM/Tutorial/Artist 
(add_map, add_icon, add_anim, add_sprite, test_art)
-Sign your name below each tutorial you watched.

AUDIO ONLY:
-Watch all the tutorials below TEAM/Tutorial/Audio 
(add_sfx, add_song)
-Sign your name below each tutorial you watched.


### Note: I'm currently working on recording the tutorials. They should be up by Friday.

I decided to make some changes about the project based on the results of the first meeting.
The meeting summary can be found under TEAM/meeting/2013-12-14.
It will take a lot more time than what I have anticipated to explain how the game works and how you can contribute to the project.

Therefore, I decided to modify the way meetings works to be more appropriate to the current state of the project.

Instead of explaining ideas during meetings, I will write down those ideas on cloud9 and I will also release tutorial videos.
You will be able to read the ideas and watch the videos anytime you want, making it more convenient for both you and me. 
It will also be far less time consuming.

Meetings will be used mostly to discuss those ideas and ask questions. 
You can also ask questions at any given time via TEAM/question on cloud9 or talk to me directly on the cloud9 chat. 

Please send me your cloud9 username so I can grant you Read/Write Access on cloud9.

I plan to make another meeting next week for each major development group (Programmer, Artist, Sound, Design, Lore).
The meeting will be exclusively about your specific discipline.
Before the meeting, you will be asked to read the ideas and watch the videos related to your group.
Please write your responibilities in TEAM/meeting/future_meeting so I can schedule a meeting that fits everyone.

Thanks again for your time.
