SPECIAL SETTINGS:

-Battle of the Gods:
    Every 100 years, every god is teleported to Earth in their mortal form.
    They need to fight eachothers, helped by their followers, until one of the gods dies.
    When only 1 god remains, 9 new gods are chosen to replace the fallen ones.
    Gods grant special blessings to their followers. A race that lost their god is weaker.
    
-Sealed Artefact
    Every 100 years, in the middle of the continent, a passage opens which contains a powerful artefact.
    Gods/(Or just the races) fight eachother to get this artefact.
    The artefact only lasts for 1 year before returning to the sealed passage.

-Fallen Artefact
    Same than sealed artefact but the artefact falls from the sky every 100 years and races hunt for it.
